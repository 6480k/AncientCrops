    "Mail_GuntherAncientFlower1": "Hey @,^^  I hear you've successfully grown that ancient seed I taught you to craft. I’ve got some more seeds for you to try your hand at, if you’re up to it. Try planting these during Spring, but be aware that they’re the last existing seeds of their kind in the whole world. If you want to plant these flowers again, you'll need to reproduce them using a seed maker.^^  -Gunther %item object"
